# WONDER WOMAN (BMZ-AI), May, 2019
### Mini, Bella, Zia


## Motivation:
When the TV goes to sleep it displays random pictures of places. The TV provided no details, and my friends and I would argue about where they were taken. This turned into a guessing game, but for most pictures, we couldn’t prove who was right.  We decided an app that could ‘look-up’ these pictures would solve this problem, and the app could play a game too.

## Description:
Our application allows users to upload any image, and then quickly see a description of that image by using the Microsft Cognitive Service Computer Vision API. The site has also a game powered by the same API.
 
## Results:
We built an app using the  Microsft Cognitive Service Computer Vision API API and an uploader, and the other DotDot API to retrieve details about an image that was uploaded.  Now, an image can be uploaded to the app, and it displays details. We also added a game feature, to provide the experience without the TV.
